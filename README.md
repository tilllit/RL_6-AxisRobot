# 6-AxisRobot

<br />
This project uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to teach a 6-Axis robot to drive on a given trajectory and reach a requested angle. <br />
The RL approach uses function approximation with a Neural Network (NN) to learn the trajectory. <br />
The used REINFORCE algorithm is based on an implementation from "Foundations of Deep Reinforcement learning"  by L Graesser and W Keng.
